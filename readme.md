# Overview

I created and animated a 3D scene for a haunted house with some bushes, graves and a couple of lights floating around.
The scene was built using ThreeJS, a Javascript library for 3D modeling and animation.

The reason I created this project is because I want to learn how to build 3d websites to do my personal portfolio and some other projects

# Development Environment

To build the application, I used Javascript, a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc.

As a library, I used ThreeJS, a cross-browser JavaScript library and application programming interface (API) used to create and display animated 3D computer graphics in a web browser using WebGL.

# Future Work

- Put names on graves
- Include message above door
- Include another object to make it spooky
